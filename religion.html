        <h1>Religion in Illyria</h1>
        <p>
            Similar to most ancient civilizations, Illyrians were polytheistic (meaning they worshiped more than one god). <br>
            Their gods mainly had roles in nature, and symbols found on coins, monuments and altars suggest they were apart <br>
            of the prehistoric cult of the sun. There doesn't seem to be one single prominent god like, and some deities <br>
            only appeared in specific regions of Illyria. They belived in supernatural powers mythological protectors, but <br>
            not much is known as far as specifics go.
