        <h1>Illyrian Society</h1>
        <p>
            Illyrians were divided into tribes that were each their own self-governing community. The most well known <br>
            (and also the last) tribe was ruled by King Agron in 3rd century BCE. King Agron died suddenly and left <br>
            his widow, Teuta, as the ruling queen. She attacked Sicily and Rome, which led to their conquering and <br>
            addition to the roman empire, where they became an important link for trade around Eurpoe. Specificaly, <br>
            they traded in wine, oil, cheese, and fish.
